        <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew!</h1>

        <p>
          I grew up in Calgary, studied film in university, worked on documentaries
          in my 20s, travelled, won the real estate lottery, lived in Kyoto,
          and finally settled in Ottawa to launch a <a href="http://walkitoff.ca">dog-walking business</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phew! During that time, I taught myself how to code and design for the web.
