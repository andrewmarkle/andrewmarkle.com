        <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew!</h1>

        <p>
          I grew up in Calgary, studied film in university, worked on documentaries
          in my 20s, travelled, made some money in real estate, moved to Japan with a woman
          I had just met, fell in love in Kyoto, and finally settled in Ottawa
          to launch a successful dog-walking business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phew! During that time, I taught myself how to code and design for the web.
