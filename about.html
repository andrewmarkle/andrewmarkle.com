  <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew!</h1>
  <p>
    I grew up in Calgary, studied film in university, worked on documentaries
    in my 20s, travelled, won the real estate lottery, lived in Kyoto,
    and finally settled in Ottawa to launch a <a href="http://walkitoff.ca">dog-walking business</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Phew! During that time, I taught myself how to code and design for the web.
    Right now I'm mostly working on a <a href="https://github.com/andrewmarkle/ha">Rails app for other dog walkers</a>.
