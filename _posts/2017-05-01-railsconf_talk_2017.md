title:  "RailsConf Talk - Decoupling your models with form objects"
---

I gave a talk at [RailsConf 2017](http://www.railsconf.com/program#session-156) in Pheonix, Arizona. Such an amazing experience!

Here's the blurb:

Forms are a crucial part of every app and Rails has good defaults for building them—unless you need something complicated. Maybe you want a multi-step wizard? Or maybe you'd like to pluck attributes from any model? Validation becomes a pain point. So you introduce a state machine, or nest your models, or do some other calisthenic to get everything working. Thankfully there's a better way! This talk takes a complicated wizard and converts it into a few simple form objects—it's a deep dive on decoupling models and how you can leverage Trailblazer's Reform gem to make it even easier.
