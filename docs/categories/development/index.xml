      <description>I gave a talk at RailsConf 2017 in Pheonix, Arizona. Such an amazing experience!
 Here&amp;rsquo;s the blurb:
Forms are a crucial part of every app and Rails has good defaults for building themâ€”unless you need something complicated. Maybe you want a multi-step wizard? Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;d like to pluck attributes from any model? Validation becomes a pain point. So you introduce a state machine, or nest your models, or do some other calisthenic to get everything working.</description>
